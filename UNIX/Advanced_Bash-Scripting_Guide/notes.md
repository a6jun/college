* .bashrc is a shell script executed when a new terminal session is opened in interactive mode, ie. ctrl + alt + t.
* "rc" stands for run commmands.
* User written shell scripts that are Bourne shell compliant generally take a name with a .sh extension. System scripts like /etc/rc.d do not necessarily conform to this nomenclature.
* /etc/rc.d is a script that is executed when the Linux system boots up. It restores system configuration and sets up services.
* Bash - Bourne Again SHell
